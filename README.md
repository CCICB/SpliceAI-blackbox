# SpliceAI-blackbox
Using explainable AI to crack open the black box of SpliceAI

# File structure

* motif_distillation/: Code to reproduce activation maximization
* motif_characterization/: Code to train surrogate multinomial model and localize motifs
* data-in/: Raw input data used by scripts
* data-out/: Intermediate processed data generated by scripts
* results/: Intermediate results generated by scripts
* SpliceAI-master/: SpliceAI model used by scripts

# PWM Location
PWMs generated using activation maximization by gradient ascent are stored in results/A-ascend/
